# M64x4-Eliza
My implementation of Eliza for Minimal 64x4. This version of the most famous chatterbot in history is written in assembly as an exercise for a mind, also to increase software library of fun, but still uderrated, Minimal64x4 platform.
ELIZA Doctor script simulates rogerian psychotherapist and was originally invented by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1967. Below clone is based on simplified Basic version of Eliza by Jeff Shrager 1973. Eliza source code can be relatively easily enriched by adding further new keywords and responses.

v1.0 Inherits 99% of Jeff Shrager's basic logic with some cosmetic additions, it's fairy faithful to the basic source.

v1.1 Is upgraded by enlarging keyword and response database. I used other Eliza implementations found on the Internet and also added my original conversation ideas. This version randomizes responses, so they are not always given in the same order. 

Please note this software will only work on revision 1.1 of Minimal 64x4 as revision 1.4 Redux is not backward compatible compatible.
