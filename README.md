# M64x4-Eliza
My implementation of Eliza for Minimal64x4. This version of the most famous chatterbot in history is written in assembly as an exercise for a mind, also to increase software library of fun, but still uderrated, Minimal64x4 platform.
ELIZA Doctor script simulates rogerian psychotherapist and was originally invented by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1967. Below clone is based on simplified Basic version of Eliza by Jeff Shrager 1973. It inherits 99% of Jeff Shrager's basic logic with some cosmetic additions, but can be relatively easily enriched by adding new keywords and responses.

v1.0 by Mateusz Matysiak (Hellboy73) May 2025
